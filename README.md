# Dice Game
This is a simple dice game implemented in Python. The game is played between two players who take turns rolling a dice. The player with the higher number on their dice wins the round. In case both players roll the same number, it is considered a draw.

# Rules
1. Each player rolls a six-sided dice. The numbers on the dice range from 1 to 6.
2. The player who rolls the higher number wins the round.
3. If both players roll the same number, it is a draw.

# Implementation
The game is implemented in JavaScript using a combination of functions and conditional statements. The random module is used to simulate the dice rolls. The program refreshes the web page for the players to roll the dice and displays the results. It then determines the winner or declares a draw.
